# dummy-operator
A simple dummy controller for managing nginx pods.

## Description
The dummy operator is a custom Kubernetes controller used for creating nginx pods and giving a status field to the Custom Resource that tracks the
status of the Nginx Pod associated with the CR (Dummy).

The dummy operator has three objectives:

1. Logs the Spec of the Custom Resource (`name`, `namespace` and
   the value of `spec.message`).
2. Copies the value of `spec.message` into `status.specEcho` for each CR (Dummy).
3. Creates and associates an `nginx` Pod to each Dummy API object and gives CR (Dummy) a status field that tracks the status of the Pod associated to the Dummy.

## Technologies
The project has been created using these technologies:

* **golang** as programming language
* **Kubernetes** as container-orchestration system
* **kubectl** as command-line tool to interact kubernetes
* **Kubebuilder** as a framework for building Kubernetes APIs using custom resource definitions (CRDs)

## Installation
**Install:**

1. `golang v1.19.0+` from <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">here</a>
2. `Docker 17.03+` from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a> then enable kubernetes
3. `kubectl  v1.11.3+` from <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">here</a>
4. `Kubebuilder 3.7.0` from <a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html">here</a>

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
>In this project, controller deployed in a Kubernetes single-node cluster inside Docker Desktop rather than KIND or remote cluster.

### Cloning the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mmertdogann/dummy-operator
```

### Running on the cluster

>For testing the controller we can either deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster with `make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag` command  or
we can directly run the controller with `make run IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag` command.

### Test the controller by deploying it on the cluster

1. Build and push the controller image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dummy-operator:tag
```

>>> The dummy controller image named `mmertdogann/dummy-operator:0.1` has already built and pushed to the docker hub.

So we can deploy our dummy controller using this command:

```sh
make deploy IMG=mmertdogann/dummy-operator:0.1
```

After this command, the controller will be deployed under `dummy-operator-system`namespace

Controller logs could be observed by this command:

```sh
k logs -f <pod-name> -n dummy-operator-system -c manager
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Test the controller by running
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run the controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```
